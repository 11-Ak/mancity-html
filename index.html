    <h2>OUR HISTORY</h2>
    <div class="history">
        <p>        Manchester City traces its history to a football team founded in 1880 by members of St. Mark’s Church in Manchester. That team became Ardwick Association Football Club in 1887 and Manchester City Football Club (FC) in 1894. From 1894 to 2008 the club moved among the upper tiers of English football, regularly suffering relegation and winning promotion. It was champion of football’s second tier seven times, and it won the Football League First Division championship twice. After winning back-to-back promotions following the 1998–99 and 1999–2000 seasons that enabled the club to ascend to English football’s top-tier English Premier League, Manchester City was once again relegated to the sport’s second tier after their lacklustre 2000–01 season. The club returned to the Premier League in 2002, however, and has remained there. In 2003 Manchester City moved from Maine Road, the stadium where it had played since 1923, to the City of Manchester Stadium (later also called Etihad Stadium).
